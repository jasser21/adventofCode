# Advent of Code 2024 - Java Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges, implemented in Java.

## Structure

The solutions are organized by day, with each day's challenge in its own folder:

```
├── Day01/
│
├── Day02/
│
...
```

## Disclaimer

These solutions are my personal attempts at solving the Advent of Code challenges. They:

- Focus on getting the correct answer rather than optimal performance
- May not represent the most efficient or elegant solutions
- Are shared for learning purposes and to compare different approaches
- Might not include extensive error handling or edge cases

## Contributing

While this repository primarily serves as a personal archive of my solutions, feel free to:

- Use these solutions as a reference
- Suggest improvements through issues
- Share alternative approaches

## Progress

I'll update this section as I complete more challenges.
